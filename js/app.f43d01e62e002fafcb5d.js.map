By binding the view to view model properties, the data binder can handle view updates, without the need to manually set changed data back to the view (e.g. no more setText() or setVisibility() on a TextView).

For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire\n     * group becomes invalid.\n     *\n     * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n     * along with {@link FormControl} and {@link FormArray}.\n     *\n     * @howToUse\n     *\n     * When instantiating a {@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first\n     * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * ```\n     * const form = new FormGroup({\n     *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n     *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),\n     * });\n     *\n     * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}\n     * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'\n     * ```\n     *\n     * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async\n     * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n     * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * ```\n     * const form = new FormGroup({\n     *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n     *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n     * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n     *\n     *\n     * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n     *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n     *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * @stable\n     */\n    var FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$6(FormGroup, _super);\n        function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n            if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n            if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n            _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n            this.controls = controls;\n            this._initObservables();\n            this._setUpControls();\n            this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        }\n        /**\n         * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n         *\n         * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\n         * most cases you'll want to use {@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\n         */\n        FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\n            if (this.controls[name])\n                return this.controls[name];\n            this.controls[name] = control;\n            control.setParent(this);\n            control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n            return control;\n        };\n        /**\n         * Add a control to this group.\n         */\n        FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n            this.updateValueAndValidity();\n            this._onCollectionChange();\n        };\n        /**\n         * Remove a control from this group.\n         */\n        FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\n            if (this.controls[name])\n                this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n            delete (this.controls[name]);\n            this.updateValueAndValidity();\n            this._onCollectionChange();\n        };\n        /**\n         * Replace an existing control.\n         */\n        FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\n            if (this.controls[name])\n                this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n            delete (this.controls[name]);\n            if (control)\n                this.registerControl(name, control);\n            this.updateValueAndValidity();\n            this._onCollectionChange();\n        };\n        /**\n         * Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n         *\n         * It will return false for disabled controls.

You can then access the control using the\n     * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n     * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n     * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n     *\n     * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n     *\n     * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n     * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n     *\n     * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n     * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n     * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n     * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n     *\n     * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n     * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n     * than the domain model's value on submit.\n     *\n     * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n     *\n     * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n     *\n     * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n     * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n     *\n     * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n     *\n     *  @stable\n     */\n    var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$7(NgModel, _super);\n        function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            /** @internal */\n            this._control = new FormControl();\n            /** @internal */\n            this._registered = false;\n            this.update = new EventEmitter();\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n            this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n            this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n        }\n        NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            this._checkForErrors();\n            if (!this._registered)\n                this._setUpControl();\n            if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                this._updateDisabled(changes);\n            }\n            if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                this._updateValue(this.model);\n                this.viewModel = this.model;\n            }\n        };\n        NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n        Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n            get: function () { return this._control; },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?
